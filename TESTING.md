Selenium

Selenium is the tool I used to run automated UI/UX tests for the browser.

Jetpacks with PostMan
---------------------

PostMan is the tool I used to implement API tests.

For this, you need to either buy the Jetpacks extension for the PostMan extension in chrome, or subscribe for the free trial.

Once installed and logged in, import the following collection of API test cases: https://www.getpostman.com/collections/ac8cb011ecadf7bdf657

To run the collection, go to the top bar and select "Collection runner" and select the "CS 263" collection with no environment.  Run all the tests!

At the time of this writing, all API test cases are passing.
